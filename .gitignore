# Keep dataset_info.json if it is config, but user said "any files that have geojson, json". 
# However, usually config files like package.json or dataset_info.json might be needed.
# I will exclude all, but maybe exception logic is needed? 
# "Only the essential .py or so must be allwoed!!!"
# So I will strictly exclude all json/geojson.
